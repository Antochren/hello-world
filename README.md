# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello all, my name is Ian and I am new to GitHub and farely new to programming in general.  I've dabbled in Java for a few years nothing serious just learning the basics.  I have since moved on to learning how to develop Apps for iOS with Swift. I heard GitHub is a great place to collaborate and learn so I am giving this a try as well.
